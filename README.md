# Woofer Pro website

This was originally a website for woofer.pro that I was asked to do, however Woofer went silent and didn't speak to me for quite some time 
so I just figured I might as well release it to the public and let it see the light of day!

It is currently hosted on CloudFlare pages at woofer.hyperthread.cc so feel free to check it out, use it, steal it, I don't care.

It's made using Tailwind CSS and turnstile for verification. It does nothing as of right now and is purely cosmetic.
